data-au Plugin for DokuWiki

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:data-au

(Well - when I get around to doing unit testing and then create a 
plugin page - until then, that was worthless information. Sorry).

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/dataau/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.

All blame to me. All credit to Andreas.

Testing has been... actually, no real testing has been done yet. 
Use at your own risk (if it breaks you get to keep both pieces). 
Feedback appreciated.
